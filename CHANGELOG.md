All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Removed
- Coverage folder from git tracking (now properly ignored)

### Changed
- CLI argument `--env-file`/`-e` to specify custom environment file
- Default environment file changed from `.env` to `.env.secret-agents`

- NodeClaudeService now downloads images before starting Claude sessions
- Fresh sessions after token limit also include previously downloaded images
- Agent now has better social awareness when reading Linear comments ðŸŽ­
  - Only responds to comments without @ mentions (general conversation)
  - Always responds when directly @ mentioned (someone needs the agent!)
  - Politely ignores when other users are @ mentioned but not the agent (respecting private conversations)
- Image storage location moved from project directory to home directory
  - Images are now stored in `~/.linearsecretagent/<workspace>/images` instead of `.linear-images` in project
  - Prevents workspace pollution and eliminates need to update `.gitignore`
  - Follows same pattern as conversation history storage
- Image file type detection from content
  - Automatically detects actual file type (png, jpg, gif, etc.) from downloaded content
  - No longer relies on URL extensions which Linear doesn't provide
  - Falls back to .png if file type cannot be determined
